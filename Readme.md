# HR Classification for Promotion

This project focuses on analyzing HR-related data to classify employees who are potentially eligible for promotion. The goal is to provide insights into factors influencing promotions within the company and to create a predictive model using linear regression to identify employees with a high likelihood of being promoted.

## Data Analytics Insights <a name="data-analytics-insights"></a>

In this section, we analyze various aspects of the employee dataset to uncover insights related to department headcounts, attrition, employee demographics, training performance, and more. Some of the insights include:

- Key departments contributing significantly to headcounts.
- Analysis of attrition and new hires.
- Gender diversity and inclusiveness efforts.
- Age distribution and employee demographics.
- Employee preferences for training courses.

## Linear Regression Model <a name="linear-regression-model"></a>

The linear regression model aims to predict employees who are potential candidates for promotion. The model considers factors such as KPI assessment, training scores, and awards. While the model's prediction accuracy is 91%, it's important to note that model predictions should be used as a reference rather than the sole basis for decision-making.
